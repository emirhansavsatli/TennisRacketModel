The dataset includes 193 images.
TennisRacket are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via histogram equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random rotation of between -45 and +45 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -32 and +32 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1 pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -17째 to +17째 vertically
